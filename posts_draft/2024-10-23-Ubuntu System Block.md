## Ubuntu System Block 

I met ubutun system restart and block due to full of disk. The root reason is full of disk ("$"), however, by transfer in and out, this is not a problem.
So, it this situation, I stuck into the system login. if you saw "DEL: F12: END", and it doesn't work when you press the corresponding keys. Never mind! You can restart the system and press multi 'Shift' into the 'Grub' menu.
