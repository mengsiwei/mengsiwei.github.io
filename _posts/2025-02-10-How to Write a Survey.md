### Experience

#### First phase [collection and outline]

Almost 6 months ago, my advisors proposed that we can write a Survey in this field. Then, this note will come. 
At first, I made a literature review and collection in this field to have a knowledge of paper volume. At the suggestion of my advisor, a table used to record papers born. Don’t worry to add more unrelated papers, because it will increase linearly with time.
I tried to make some classification, but it is so difficulty to make a clear classification. 
Then, I quoted, and draft an outline on Survey architecture. The efficient way to draft an outline is find a reference. 

#### Second phase [add, add, and add]

At the beginning, it is very hard for me to write any meaningful content onto it. I have no idea where I start. Then, my advisor suggested maybe you can add one paper you have read. Don’t care the connection, just add it. Thus, we set a goal that every week, read, summarize, and add around three papers in this area. This is a long process, please hang in there, and be regular. You will have fun.

#### Third phase [draft]

Now, this survey cannot be name an article, because there is no connection with each part, and especially each paper. Luckily, you will have some ideas on how to classification, how to organize each parts. It's amazing, but it's the truth.
I first make a relative mature classification system. Actually, I have modified several version of this classification.


#### Fourth phase [polish]

First of all, the biggest problem lies in organization between each part. It will be weird if you just go directly into the content without transition sentence.
Second, give the corresponding solution or existing progress after you propose a problem.
Finally, a good visualization or table can leave impression.
