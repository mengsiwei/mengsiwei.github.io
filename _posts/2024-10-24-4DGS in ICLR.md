## 4DGS 

This is a sample blog post. You can talk about all sorts of fun things here.

### Preliminary

#### 3DGS

We all know 3DGS use a series of Gaussian Points to simulation the scene. The scene rendering is a differentiable rasterization process, aiming at getting the color of a certain pixel $$(u,v)$$ in the direction of observation $$d$$. This can be formulated as,

$$
I(u,v)=\sum_{i=1}^Np_i(u,v;\mu_i^{2d},\Sigma_i^{2d})\alpha_ic_i(d_i)\prod_{j=1}^{i-1}(1-p_j(u,v;\mu_i^{2d},\Sigma_i^{2d})\alpha_j)
$$

### 4DGS

#### Problem formulation

Back to 4DGS, the naive idea is to add the time $$t$$ directly into the above 3DGS rendering formula. Then, we can obtain,

$$
I(u,v,t)=\sum_{i=1}^Np_i(u,v,t)\alpha_ic_i(d)\prod_{j=1}^{i-1}(1-p_j(u,v,t)\alpha_j)
$$

if we assume time and space are independent, we can further use joint probability to decompose the probability density. And we can transfer the naive 4DGS formula into,

$$
I(u,v,t)=\sum_{i=1}^Np_i(t)p_i(u,v|t)\alpha_ic_i(d_i)\prod_{j=1}^{i-1}(1-p_j(t)p_j(u,v|t)\alpha_j)
$$

Now, we decompose the color contribution $$p_i(u,v,t)$$ of each Gaussian into the margin probability $$p_i(t)$$ at time t, and the conditional space probability $$p_i(u,v|t)$$ at time $$t$$.

```tsql
SELECT This, [Is], A, Code, Block -- Using SSMS style syntax highlighting
    , REVERSE('abc')
FROM dbo.SomeTable s
    CROSS JOIN dbo.OtherTable o;
```

#### Some PowerShell Code

```powershell
Write-Host "This is a powershell Code block";

# There are many other languages you can use, but the style has to be loaded first

ForEach ($thing in $things) {
    Write-Output "It highlights it using the GitHub style"
}
```
