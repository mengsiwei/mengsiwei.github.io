## Ubuntu System Block 

I met ubutun system restart and block due to full of disk. The root reason is full of disk ("$"), however, by transfer in and out, this is not a problem.
So, it this situation, I stuck into the system login. if you saw "DEL: F12: END", and it doesn't work when you press the corresponding keys. Never mind! You can restart the system and press multi 'Shift' into the 'Grub' menu.

This is a sample blog post. You can talk about all sorts of fun things here.

### This is a header

#### Some T-SQL Code

```tsql
SELECT This, [Is], A, Code, Block -- Using SSMS style syntax highlighting
    , REVERSE('abc')
FROM dbo.SomeTable s
    CROSS JOIN dbo.OtherTable o;
```

#### Some PowerShell Code

```powershell
Write-Host "This is a powershell Code block";

# There are many other languages you can use, but the style has to be loaded first

ForEach ($thing in $things) {
    Write-Output "It highlights it using the GitHub style"
}
```
