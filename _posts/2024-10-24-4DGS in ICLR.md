## 4DGS 

I met ubutun system restart and block due to full of disk. The root reason is full of disk ("$"), however, by transfer in and out, this is not a problem.
So, it this situation, I stuck into the system login. if you saw "DEL: F12: END", and it doesn't work when you press the corresponding keys. Never mind! You can restart the system and press multi 'Shift' into the 'Grub' menu. 

If the file does not start with a header, then the post title will be derived from the filename.

This is a sample blog post. You can talk about all sorts of fun things here.

### Preliminary

#### 3DGS

We all know 3DGS use a series of Gaussian Points to simulation the scene. The scene rendering is a differentiable rasterization process, aiming at getting the color of a certain pixel $$(u,v)$$ in the direction of observation $$d$$. This can be formulate as,

$$
I(u,v)=\sum_{i=1}^Np_i(u,v;\mu_i^{2d},\Sigma_i^{2d})\alpha_ic_i(d_i)\prod_{j=1}^{i-1}(1-p_j(u,v;\mu_i^{2d},\Sigma_i^{2d})\alpha_j)
$$

```tsql
SELECT This, [Is], A, Code, Block -- Using SSMS style syntax highlighting
    , REVERSE('abc')
FROM dbo.SomeTable s
    CROSS JOIN dbo.OtherTable o;
```

#### Some PowerShell Code

```powershell
Write-Host "This is a powershell Code block";

# There are many other languages you can use, but the style has to be loaded first

ForEach ($thing in $things) {
    Write-Output "It highlights it using the GitHub style"
}
```
